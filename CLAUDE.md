# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Honeycomb3 is a full-stack FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) framework built on Meteor.js. It provides a TEFCA-compliant FHIR server, consent management, and SMART on FHIR support.

**Tech Stack**: Meteor v3 + React 18 + Material-UI v5 + MongoDB + FHIR R4

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run locally
meteor run --settings settings/settings.honeycomb.localhost.json

# Run tests
npm test
```

## NPM Workflow Packages

Clinical/workflow functionality ships as **NPM workflow packages** — a plugin-style
architecture on standard NPM tooling that replaced the Atmosphere.js `packages/`
era (migration completed 2026-06-14; the old `packages/` dir is retired to
`deprecated/`). A package is a normal npm workspace exposing `client.js` /
`server.js` / `workflow.json`; the workflow parser resolves them **by package name
via node_modules symlinks**, so the *directory* a package lives in is purely
organizational (git/licensing posture) and does not affect loading — `npmPackages/`,
`extensions/`, and `core/` load identically.

| Directory | Git | License | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|---------|
| `npmPackages/*` | **tracked in this monorepo** | per package (mostly MIT) | The workflow-package home — ships with the distribution |
| `core/*` | tracked in this monorepo | Apache-2.0 | Reserved for the Apache-licensed core subset (currently just a stub) |
| `extensions/*` | **gitignored**, each its own nested repo | UNLICENSED / private | Private / user-defined / trade-secret; nothing here is checked into this monorepo (only the directory `CLAUDE.md` stub is) |

Licensing posture: AGPL main app / MIT-or-Apache workflow packages / UNLICENSED
extensions. To add a private package, give it its own git repo under
`extensions/<name>/` (it stays out of the monorepo); to add a package that ships
with honeycomb, put it under `npmPackages/<name>/` and commit it normally. Run
`npm install` to symlink either into `node_modules/`.

### Registration: central manifest vs. self-declaring extensions

There are two ways a package is activated, and **the central manifest is
reserved for `@node-on-fhir` (distribution) packages only** — do NOT bloat
`workflows/workflows.json` with private namespaces (`@orbital/*`,
`@awatson1978/*`, `@merkalis/*`, …):

- **`@node-on-fhir/*` packages that ship with honeycomb** → register in
  `workflows/workflows.json` (entry, `serverEntry`, `hooksEntry`, `enabled`).
- **Private extensions (any other namespace)** → stay OUT of the manifest.
  Activate them via the `EXTRA_WORKFLOWS` env var, and let each package
  **self-declare its server entry in its own `workflow.json`**.

#### serverEntry resolution (the `./server` vs `./server/methods` gotcha)

The workflow parser (`workflows/rspack.workflowParser.js`) resolves each
package's `serverEntry` with precedence:

1. central manifest (`workflows/workflows.json`) — operator override
2. **the package's own `workflow.json`** — how extensions declare it
3. built-in default `"./server/methods"` ⚠️

The default `./server/methods` is a trap: it imports only methods and **silently
skips publications, cron, and collection init** — and it fails outright if the
package's `package.json` `exports` map gates the `./server/methods` subpath
(only exposing `./server`), producing `Cannot find module
'@scope/pkg/server/methods'` at boot. **Every package should declare
`"serverEntry": "./server"`** (the full entry: collections → methods →
publications → cron via `server/index.js`) — in its `workflow.json` for
extensions, or in the manifest for `@node-on-fhir` packages. The parser prints a
`WARN` when a package falls through to the default.

### Running with Extra Workflows

```bash
EXTRA_WORKFLOWS=@node-on-fhir/example-workflow meteor run --settings settings/settings.honeycomb.localhost.json
```

### Creating New Workflows

Use the `/create-npm-workflow` command:
```
/create-npm-workflow MyWorkflow
```

Or copy the template package:
```bash
cp -r npmPackages/example-workflow npmPackages/my-workflow
```

**More details**: See `npmPackages/CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive documentation on:
- Package structure and exports
- workflow.json configuration
- Server methods with Meteor v3 async
- WorkflowRegistry integration
- Migration from Atmosphere.js

## Desktop Build (Electron)

The `npmPackages/desktop-lattice/` package wraps the Meteor app into a standalone Electron desktop app with embedded MongoDB. See `npmPackages/desktop-lattice/README.md` for full documentation.

### Key setup steps

```bash
# 1. Install desktop-lattice devDependencies (electron, electron-builder) from the workspace root
cd /path/to/nof3100
npm install -w @lattice/desktop --include=dev

# 2. Production build (macOS, dark/DICOM theme with extra packages)
cd npmPackages/desktop-lattice
npm run dev:dark
```

### Known build issues

- **Heap out of memory during `meteor build`**: The build script sets `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` automatically. If still insufficient, export a higher value before building.
- **`app-builder_arm64 ENOENT`**: Means `electron-builder` dependencies aren't installed. Run `npm install -w @lattice/desktop --include=dev` from the project root. Because this is an npm workspace, running `npm install` from inside `desktop-lattice/` alone does not work.

## DICOM Parsing (dcmjs)

DICOM metadata extraction runs on the **dcmjs rewrite** — our fork at
`libraries/dcmjs` (git submodule, github.com/awatson1978/dcmjs, branch
`development`), consumed as the root `"dcmjs": "file:libraries/dcmjs"`
dependency. `workzone/dcmjs` is gitignored scratch; the submodule is canonical.

```bash
# After fresh clone: init the submodule, then plain npm install builds the
# bundle automatically (scripts/postinstall-dcmjs.js — pnpm-free, uses the
# rollup reified from the root lockfile, and FAILS the install loudly if the
# bundle can't be produced). pnpm is only needed for parser development.
# The CircleCI `onboarding` job gates exactly this clean-clone path.
git submodule update --init libraries/dcmjs
npm install                # postinstall builds libraries/dcmjs/build/ (gitignored)
npm run dcmjs:setup        # same guard, runnable standalone for recovery
npm run dcmjs:build        # force rebuild via pnpm (parser development)
npm run dcmjs:watch        # rollup watch mode while developing the parser
npm run test:dicom         # node --test parity suite (dcmjs vs dicom-parser)
```

- **Adapter**: `imports/ui/DICOM/utils/DcmjsMetadata.js` — parses via dcmjs and
  feeds the existing `DicomFhirMapping.js` extractors through a
  dicom-parser-compatible dataSet adapter; falls back to dicom-parser on parse
  failure. Use `extractAllDicomMetadataFromArrayBuffer()` +
  `flattenDicomMetadataForGridFS()` in new code.
- **Consumers**: `/dicom/upload` (UploadPage), radiology-workflow TechDashboard,
  data-importer binary import (`/import-data`). Cornerstone rendering keeps its
  own internal parser.
- **Meteor restart required** after rebuilding the bundle (node_modules changes
  aren't watched).
- Developing the parser: commit/push inside `libraries/dcmjs` (it's a full
  clone of the fork), then bump the submodule pointer here.

## Critical Anti-Pattern: ID Lookup with OR Logic

**NEVER use OR logic when looking up records by ID.** This is the #1 bug in Honeycomb and causes ID collisions.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Can match multiple records causing ID collisions!
const patientId = get(patient, 'id') || get(patient, '_id');
const record = collection.find(p => p.id === value || p._id === value);

// ✅ CORRECT - Use MongoDB _id (primary key) only
const patientId = get(patient, '_id');
const record = collection.find(p => p._id === value);
```

**Why**: After data transformation (e.g., `flattenPatient()`), records have **BOTH** `_id` (MongoDB primary key) and `id` (FHIR identifier). Using OR logic can match multiple records:

```javascript
{
  _id: '5832e8a0ea861706b1857c49',  // MongoDB primary key
  id: '23c65305-e7da-3fa8-e7c9-92d6199dd40e'  // FHIR identifier
}
```

Using OR logic (`||`) can cause catastrophic ID collisions:
- Patient A: `{ _id: 'abc123', id: 'xyz789' }`
- Patient B: `{ _id: 'xyz789', id: 'def456' }`
- Looking up `'xyz789'` with OR logic matches **BOTH** patients!
- `.find()` returns whichever comes first (wrong patient)

**Real-World Impact:** This bug caused test patients to open the wrong patient details page, showing "Kylee Leannon" instead of the test patient. With 293+ patients in the database, ID collisions are inevitable.

**When You Need FHIR ID:**

Get it from the found record after lookup, don't use it for the lookup itself:

```javascript
// Find by MongoDB _id
const patient = Patients.findOne({ _id: mongoId });

// Then extract FHIR id for navigation or display
const fhirId = patient.id;
navigate(`/patients/${fhirId}`);
```

**MongoDB _id is the source of truth** for all record lookups. FHIR `id` is just a field and should only be used for:
- Display purposes
- FHIR API compliance
- Navigation URLs (after lookup)

**More details**: See `.claude/rules/anti-patterns/id-lookup.md`

## Critical Anti-Pattern: Secrets in Source Code

**NEVER hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in source files.** Always pass secrets via `Meteor.settings` (loaded from a settings JSON file) or environment variables. Settings files containing real credentials must be `.gitignored`.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Secret committed to git history
const apiKey = 'pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6...';
const url = `https://api.example.com?key=sk_live_abc123`;

// ✅ CORRECT - Read from Meteor.settings (private)
const apiKey = get(Meteor, 'settings.private.googleMaps.apiKey', '');

// ✅ CORRECT - Read from environment variable
const apiKey = process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;
```

**Settings file pattern** (`settings/settings.*.json`):
```json
{
  "private": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": ""
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- GitHub push protection blocks pushes containing detected secrets
- Secrets in git history persist even after the code is changed — scrubbing requires force-push rebases
- Healthcare applications face HIPAA/compliance scrutiny for credential exposure

**If you need a third-party API key**, create a Meteor method that reads it server-side from `Meteor.settings.private` and returns only the data the client needs (or the key itself if the client must call the API directly).

## Development Guidelines

### Meteor v3 Async (Server-Side)
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Synchronous (Meteor v2)
const record = Observations.findOne({ _id: id });

// ✅ CORRECT: Async (Meteor v3)
const record = await Observations.findOneAsync({ _id: id });
```

**More details**: See `.claude/rules/meteor/v3-async.md`

### Material-UI Theming

MUI theme tokens are reliable (as of 2026-06-11): `CustomThemeProvider` in `imports/ui/CustomThemeProvider.jsx` sanitizes settings values at ingestion (strips legacy `!important` flags) and is the single palette authority. Prefer tokens for new code; the `Meteor.useTheme()` + `isDark` pattern remains fully supported for existing components and for reading/toggling mode state.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Unconditional hardcoded colors (locked to one mode)
<Box sx={{ backgroundColor: '#ffffff', color: '#000000' }} />

// ❌ WRONG: Reading settings colors directly in components
const color = get(Meteor, 'settings.public.theme.palette.cardColor');

// ✅ PREFERRED: Theme tokens (mode-agnostic)
<Box sx={{ backgroundColor: 'background.paper', color: 'text.primary' }} />

// ✅ SUPPORTED: Meteor.useTheme() + isDark (legacy pattern, mode state access)
const isDark = (Meteor.useTheme ? Meteor.useTheme() : { theme: 'light' }).theme === 'dark';
<Box sx={{ backgroundColor: isDark ? '#1e1e1e' : '#ffffff' }} />
```

Never add `!important` to settings color values. Root page containers shouldn't set page-level bgcolor (`StyledMainRouter` paints `background.default`).

**More details**: See `.claude/rules/ui/theming.md`

### React Navigation
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Full page reload
window.location.href = '/patients';

// ✅ CORRECT: React Router
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/patients');
```

**More details**: See `.claude/rules/anti-patterns/navigation.md`

## Additional Patterns

For comprehensive guidance on:
- **FHIR Resources**: See `.claude/rules/fhir/resource-implementation.md`
- **Patient Filtering**: See `.claude/rules/fhir/patient-filtering.md`
- **Test Patterns**: See `.claude/rules/testing/crud-patterns.md`
- **Theme Compliance**: See `.claude/rules/ui/theming.md`
- **Settings-Gated Features**: See `.claude/rules/meteor/settings-gated-features.md`
- **Footer Button Traceability**: See `.claude/rules/ui/footer-buttons.md`
- **Greedy-Height Panels**: "greedy height" means the `/import-data` pattern (full height minus header/footer, prominent-header aware, via flex cascade — not viewport math). See `.claude/rules/ui/layout-patterns.md`
- **All Anti-Patterns**: See `.claude/rules/anti-patterns/`

Use `/audit-id-lookups` and `/audit-theme` commands to scan the codebase for common issues 

## Coding Style

- **Meteor v3**: Use async/await on server (`findOneAsync`, `insertAsync`, `updateAsync`, `removeAsync`)
- **Function syntax**: Prefer `function() {}` over arrow functions for Meteor methods (preserves `this` context)
- **Lodash**: Use `get()` and `set()` for circuit breaker pattern; import functions explicitly, not `_`
- **Date/time**: Use `moment` library
- **HTTP calls**: Use `meteor/fetch` package
- **Server method calls (client)**: `await Meteor.rpc('name', { namedParams })` — never switch a call site back to `Meteor.call`/`callAsync` "for latency compensation" (this app has no client stubs, so it restores nothing and loses DevTools observability). Want optimistic UI? Add it deliberately: `.claude/rules/meteor/latency-compensation.md`
- **Routing**: Use `useNavigate()` hook, never `window.location.href`
- **Logging**: Use the structured Logger, full level gamut (`log.warn`, `log.error`, `log.group`, `log.phi`, etc.) — app code: `Logger.for('ModuleName')` from `/imports/lib/Logger.js`; packages: `const log = (Meteor.Logger ? Meteor.Logger.for('pkg') : console);`. Put objects in the `data` arg (redaction net inspects it), never interpolated into the msg string. Debugging toggles: `Meteor.Logger.focus('Module*')` / `.setThreshold('debug')` / `.reset()` from DevTools (persisted across reloads; error/warn always emit) — see `docs/LOGGING.md` § Debugging Workflow. Full reference: `docs/LOGGING.md`
- **Conditionals**: Always balance if/then with log messages, don't silently swallow
- **File headers**: Add path/name as first line (commented out)
- **No bundlers**: Don't suggest webpack, vite, etc. (Meteor has built-in bundler)
- **No index.js**: Avoid directory index files

## Healthy Paranoia Checklist Format

When discussing risky technical implementations, use `/healthit-checklist {topic}` or this format:

```markdown
### Healthy Paranoia Checklist: [Topic]

**What could still go wrong:**
- 🎯 [Specific technical risk]
- 💥 [Infrastructure/deployment concern]
- 🐛 [Likely bug or edge case]
- 📱 [Platform/device-specific issue]
- 🔒 [Security/compliance/regulatory worry]
- 😭 [Nightmare scenario]

**But remember:** [What's actually working and why that's significant]
```

This validates concerns while maintaining perspective.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
