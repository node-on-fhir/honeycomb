The files in the /imports/legacy-deprecated folder are from Node on FHIR v2 or earlier, and SHOULD NOT be imported from other files.  

The files in this directory and its subfolders are only provided for reference.  They use old syntax and need to be migrated to the latest coding standards.

DO feel free to migrate these files.  Rewrite them and include them in the app, using best practices from the STYLE_GUIDE.md document.  When migrated, prompt the user if they would like the file to be removed from the /legacy-deprecated folder.
