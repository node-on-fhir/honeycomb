## Node on FHIR  

<!-- QWERTY: Removed internal documentation link -->

#### Overview  
The NodeOnFHIR platform contains a full-stack Javascript web application environment, with first-class support for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).  The platform is envisioned as a 21st century equivalent of the MUMPS platform, in that it incorporates a document-oriented database, and a single programming language throughout.   
NodeOnFHIR uses modern ES6 Javascript on the server, database, client, mobile devices, testing, tooling, and even includes support for microcontrollers.  Formally defined via the EcmaScript language standards, the build pipeline supports all flavors of languages that compile to Ecmascript, including Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, and Node.js.  

NodeOnFHIR has been used in 100+ pilots and prototypes in the open source community and HL7 connectathons; and has been through an internal cybersecurity audit, and can be configured to be HIPAA compliant.

The platform uses isomorphic software, making it ideal for mesh networks, distributed ledger applications, and blockchains.
